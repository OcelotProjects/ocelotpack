# OcelotPack
Forget about "doubling" your FPS. We can do better.

This is a Minecraft modpack on Fabric, focusing on optimisation, customisation and stability. The goal is not to have any opinionated stuff here. This could just as well be vanilla.
Inspired by Fabulously Optimized and the OptiFine alternatives by LambdAurora.

6.25x (100 with modpack, 16 vanilla) more FPS on Intel UHD Graphics 620/Intel Core i7-8565U, 6G RAM allocated and default settings on both packs, except that V-Sync is disabled.
